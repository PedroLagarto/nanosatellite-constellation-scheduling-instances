# Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Instances

In the `standard-instances` you can find the instances used in the paper "A branch-and-price algorithm for nanosatellite task scheduling to improve mission quality-of-service".
In `new-instances` you can find new randomly generated instances along with solutions (for some of them).
The code used to generate the instances in `new-instances` can be found in the root directory.
